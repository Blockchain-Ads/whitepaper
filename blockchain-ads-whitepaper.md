# Blockchain-Ads Whitepaper

![](.gitbook/assets/0)**BLOCKCHAIN-ADS WHITEPAPER**

### **Abstract** <a href="#_v89y2kyr609" id="_v89y2kyr609"></a>

The Decentralized industry lacks an effective, default-choice advertising platform. Existing web2.0 advertising platforms are completely centralized and by default inadequate. On the other hand the current web3.0 advertising platforms generally do not comply with the principles of Decentralization in a meaningful way. Moreover, there is also a negligible utilization of blockchain technology in the advertising industry.

We propose a method to completely decentralized advertising engagements using the Blockchain-Ads.com platform and its native token (XADS), an utility token, redeemable on the Blockchain-Ads advertising platform for real-world advertising engagements.

The Blockchain-Ads advertising platform is designed to be an ergonomic, simple and effective advertising platform combining the principles of Decentralization with digital advertising.

Decentralized Ad Ecosystem Values:

* **Censorship resistance**: we empower a free and self-governed ad market with no centralised restrictions on what can and can't be advertised
* **Transparency**: Real-time collaboration between  publishers, advertiser and users, Blockchain solution for tracking  and historical data
* **No intermediaries:** connect publishers and advertisers as directly as possible, therefore maximizing results and revenues; this also implies minimized fees and no commissions
* **Reduced fees.** 90% reduction of the fees is feasible
* **Single currency.** No problem in cross border commerce
* **Privacy:** blockchain-ads is build on top of vulos blockchain, which is a private blockchain and only the user have access to his data
* **No custody of funds:** users have full control over their own funds; you can withdraw any amount at any point, no thresholds

This project has two stages of its business growth and market share.

**First,** is to provide the Decentralized community with an advertising platform that is as effective and ergonomic as the big tech advertising platforms without the associated censorship, fees, limitations and bank & identity requirements. Web3.0 Personalized advertising enabled.&#x20;

**Second**, to completely shift the current advertising focus to a decentralized ecosystem, by simply moving the competition on a different level. The focus will be on all participants in the ecosystem, and by incentivizing the publishers, advertisers and users, and leveraging the benefits of open-source leger and decentralized advertising solutions, the industry will naturally shift and evolve.

This paper will continue on the assumption that the reader possesses a basic understanding of blockchain technology and the advertising ecosystem.

### **1. Problems In Advertising We're Trying To Solve** <a href="#_t7l2f2am0ou" id="_t7l2f2am0ou"></a>

### **1.1 Centralization and Censorship** <a href="#_wer15eyb0y1r" id="_wer15eyb0y1r"></a>

The current advertising web2.0 industry is massively centralized. Few big companies own 90% of the market. All the participants in the ecosystem, advertisers, publishers and users depend on the big tech companies. Only Google and Facebook own 70% of the $400bn industry. Just because they own the data.

Massive restrictions and censorship are in place and the regulations are being determined by a group of people, even sometimes by one single person.

As the most obvious example, The most popular and widely used advertising solutions; Google, Facebook consistently made it incredibly difficult for blockchain companies to raise funds, sell their products and innovate. This is because they've consistently been blocking, banning and confounding advertisers in the blockchain industry for several years. This presents a significant obstacle and limiting factor for the growth of blockchain companies as a whole.

### **1.2 High Fees, Low-Value** <a href="#_x7p6skc7v9rb" id="_x7p6skc7v9rb"></a>

Advertising platforms are notorious for charging extremely high fees and commissions. These platform fees range from 25 - 60% in most cases.

In addition, these commissions often are compounded and multiplied when the inventory goes through multiple advertising platforms, with each platform taking a cut at each stage of the auction process. Up to 70% of ad dollars end up in the hands of the platforms, ad-exchanges and middle-men in commissions leaving only 30% for content providers. Lots of value ends up lost to intermediates as opposed to being spent on content. Lowering ROAS for advertisers.

This results in a lot of problems for the ad business. Because so many ad dollars go towards ad-tech intermediaries, a lot of value is lost for both the paying advertiser and the supply side publishers, ROI is diluted substantially as a consequence.

What makes this problem particularly challenging is that the value offered by middlemen and intermediaries is often low, this creates an atmosphere of mistrust, fraud and bad-faith in the industry.

### **1.3 Banking & Identity Requirements** <a href="#_44uux6ao3zc1" id="_44uux6ao3zc1"></a>

Furthermore, to advertise your business using one of the big tech platforms, a bank account and some form of identity documents are usually required. This bars many people in the developing world from using these platforms. In addition, the use of fiat currency and banks is required to fund an account. This requires the user to have a bank account and use the legacy financial system to participate in online advertising.

Furthermore, they are obliged to report and pay tax on what they have earned from using those advertising platforms.

### **1.4 Privacy & Transparency** <a href="#_25ebrhmsrc2l" id="_25ebrhmsrc2l"></a>

The $5 billion **penalty** against **Facebook** is the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy. And there are many more other examples. All of the power and financial benefits within these giant AdTech companies comes from the data they have on the users. The phrase, “whoever owns the information (data) owns the world”, absolutely applies in the advertising world. We can say that The big tech companies are making billions of dollars by owning our data. A concept will completely change with the introduction of the blockchain technology and the decentralized application.

Most advertising platforms get their traffic by offering a revenue share arrangement with content providers and publishers, platforms must focus on serving two customers; advertisers and publishers. This presents advertising networks with a conflict of interest; their profits are contingent upon revenue sharing with their publishers, so there is pressure to sell as much of the publisher's content for the highest price to the advertiser as possible, often compromising on traffic quality.

Not all traffic is of equal value, the vast majority of internet traffic isn't suitable for driving advertising conversions, however, because platforms rely on these content providers sharing their revenue to drive their own profits, traffic is often sold and packaged together from multiple publishers. This dilutes traffic quality and ROAS for the advertisers and drives up cost of acquisition.

### **2. Solutions - Web3.0 Advertising Ecosystem** <a href="#_1jlrvb62twy3" id="_1jlrvb62twy3"></a>

**Blockchain-Ads EcoSystem**

**Value proposition**

Blockchain-Ads is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace for display and direct advertising.

Blockchain-Ads provide complete transparency, remove central authority, cut out the middleman, reduce fraud, and lower costs for all market participants. Blockchain-Ads Network runs on Vulos Blockchain and uses Blockchain-Ads Tokens for ad payments. Fees collected from processing payments are distributed among token holders.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FmJfIadnPEmtGaPgQzsYSjNdWmSVpBTjZdMLMBTTdlYVVNi-h8PReWDGxqufbqvnfC3ZWH7vd\_5lNI7m\_CeQxGjPOV4cHimMawSSHLLQN506AIBO5TNgehhKs3JBKpvGrHNSs8UD)

The solutions that Blockchain- Ads propose:

### **2.1 Decentralized Advertising ecosystem** <a href="#_9i3ze6ezssi4" id="_9i3ze6ezssi4"></a>

Blockchain-Ads is an open platform for everyone. All of the Participants in the Advertising ecosystem will benefit and participate in its governance.

Advertisers and Publishers meet directly using the Blockchain-Ads P2P Network as the core which acts as a decentralized marketplace governed by the smart contracts.

All the current web2.0 middlemen are made redundant and their massively overestimated role is needless by default.

We intend to stay true to the decentralized principles, including a commitment for Blockchain-ads ecosystem to become fully operational DAO by the end of its full cycle at the end of 2023.

Ultimately, Blockchain-Ads is completely censorship resistant since anyone can run their own Marketplace and Platform and do whatever they want with them.

By providing a viable and effective alternative advertising solution to big tech platforms, specifically designed for the Web3.0 generation, Blockchain-Ads will play an important part in the process of freeing blockchain enterprises from the restrictions and limitations imposed upon them by censorious big tech platforms.

### **2.2 No Middleman - No Fees Or Commissions** <a href="#_emxwv6ux6xsk" id="_emxwv6ux6xsk"></a>

The primary goal for the Blockchain-Ads ecosystem is to render various ad exchanges obsolete by using the open platform that will enable advertisers and publishers to find themselves and trade directly using blockchain.

Standardized exchange and easy access to market will foster development of open algorithms that will enable publishers to be their own SSP and advertisers to be their own DSP.

Furthermore, Blockchain-Ads **does not** operate on a revenue-share basis with publishers, meaning no commissions will be charged on purchased traffic. That means a substantial amount of value that would usually go towards intermediaries and middle-men will instead go directly to supply side publishers and provide a significant boost in ROAS potential for advertisers.

Blockchain-Ads server will be funded directly by sales of the XADS token, which is required to access and buy advertising engagements on the Blockchain-Ads platform. This removes the need for us to charge a commission and gives us the ability to pay top dollar for the best performing traffic assets.

By offering 0% commission and fees, Blockchain-Ads Server will be able to pay publishers significantly more and stands to be an extremely attractive and lucrative alternative to current advertising platforms. In addition, by abolishing the revenue share / commission model, Blockchain-Ads will find it much easier to negotiate with extremely high quality traffic sources and create tangible long-term value for both the supply side and demand side of the advertising ecosystem.

More information about the business model mechanics can be in the token economics section of this document.

### **2.3 Bank - less Advertising** <a href="#_9wp378ntiwe" id="_9wp378ntiwe"></a>

There's nothing in Blockchain-Ads requiring advertisers/publishers to identify themselves with anything other than a cryptographic identity. Blockchain-Ads is an advertising platform that will exist in an economy that is completely separate from the banking system.

The XADS token replaces the use of fiat currency and does not require a bank account, therefore, anyone with a crypto wallet can access the platform, acquire a XADS balance and use the platform regardless of their identity or banking status.

More generally, we can observe that ad exchanges operating in centralized environments have huge pricing power over their users as they can enforce certain policies and accompanying services, like ad quality standards, landing page classification or data services. The smallest users are the ones most disadvantaged in this area. With an efficient, common means of payment, most of the accompanying services can move to on-demand services, competition will greatly increase and prices will fall.

In addition, we make a commitment to enable open access, without an account, utilizing the wallet sign-in mechanism to identify and manage user accounts.

### **2.4 Transparent and Secure Platform** <a href="#_nz1yehvk0tra" id="_nz1yehvk0tra"></a>

The Blockchain-Ads platform will not share revenue with publishers, instead, the Blockchain Ad Platform acts as a marketplace where publishers and advertisers communicate directly. The ad in inventories are being offered by the publishers and ad creatives to be advertised by the advertisers, The open ledger allows clear visibility which websites the ads are being shown and the ad traffic by specific zone.

This gives both parties unparalleled freedom to choose exactly what kind of traffic they provide and impressions delivered, and also eliminates the conflict of interest that arises when advertising platforms are responsible for providing monetization for their publishers.

Accounts used to receive and send payments for ads on blockchain will be linked to domains. This repository of cryptographic keys can be leveraged to authenticate events generated during ad request and delivery. This will substantially reduce surface attacks by fraudsters.

### 3. Advertising Industry Competition <a href="#_mhy21ph31xho" id="_mhy21ph31xho"></a>

The current Advertising landscape can be divided in: Web2.0 & Web3.0

### 3.1 Web2.0 - Centralized <a href="#_v505mv5rv9u" id="_v505mv5rv9u"></a>

![](.gitbook/assets/2)

Big players in the ad exchange market like Google DoubleClick, Facebook, Criteo, Bing, AppNexus, OpenX, AOL’s Marketplace own more than 80% of the advertising market as we know today. However, they are not considered as Blockchain-Ads direct competitors, based on three different factors:

\- **Technology** - Blockchain-Ads use open source technology that is being supported by and belongs to the community. All of the participants in the advertising ecosystem have voting and decision-making rights. DAO will be deployed in 2023.

\- **Business model** - Disintermediation model: No middleman is required in the new web3.0 Advertising model. Just like the banks and central authorities will be redundant with the mass adoption of DeFI the same will happen with the centralized Advertising authorities.

* **Payment** - private, bankless and borderless. The current web2.0 advertisers giants have restrictions and strict rules about who can participate and which countries are eligible to advertise and offer their publishing services. Payment can be done only by identity check that contradicts the privacy policy. Blockchain-Ads ecosystem allows payment to be done on-chain completely secured, on an open ledger.

These 3 factors will shift the weight and elevate the game on a different level. Meaning that with decentralization taking place across all industries, the Advertising Industry will adapt and evolve, leaving robust, corporate Tech giants.

### 3.2 Web3.0 Decentralized Advertising <a href="#_f3ku492v9r8d" id="_f3ku492v9r8d"></a>

There are few projects that have had an attempt to make an entry in the web3.0 advertising industry. Alkimi.exchange, Adex.Network, DragonX, BAT, Adshares.net ….&#x20;

All of them generally do not comply with the principles of Decentralization in a meaningful way. None of these projects have Blockchain solutions for tracking and historical data. The transactions and ad inventories are stored on a third party server, off-chain, which defy the whole decentralized value.&#x20;

And most importantly all these projects main purpose is to leverage the DeFi side of their projects and gather their community around that goal.&#x20;

The actual Advertising participants, Advertisers, Publishers and most importantly Users are not the core members of the community. The blockchain technology terminology is only used for marketing purposes and not actually used to solve the real problems.

### **4. Technology** <a href="#_nj8c7dpy5fjk" id="_nj8c7dpy5fjk"></a>

In summary Blockchain-Ads P2P network is based on the following model of marketplace; every advertiser creates an account on blockchain and associates it with their domain.

An advertiser uses Blockchain-Ads APIi to describe the inventory which he wishes to advertise. A typical entry will include creative content (banner, text, video), various information about the intended audience and, of course, price. It is up to the advertiser to decide which information is made public and which is to remain a secret.

Publishers use blockchain to discover advertisers and crawl their inventories. When a user visits the publisher’s site, the inventory is analyzed to find the banner with the highest expected payout. Before displaying the banner to a user, a script checks if the banner is exactly the same as the one promised in the inventory.

Advertisers have an incentive to pay a fair amount for displaying their ads or risk getting banned from the most valuable sites, or even lose bids to other advertisers. Publishers are incentivized to display the most matching ads to maximize their yield.

### 4.1 Server <a href="#_wlgy1ghn81km" id="_wlgy1ghn81km"></a>

The Blockchain-Ads protocol builds on top of blockchain technology to facilitate the parts that need achieving consensus in a trust-less, decentralized manner. This part is commonly referred to as the "Blockchain-Ads Server".

The Server has to implement everything related to moving funds between advertisers and publishers. To be more precise, it provides an implementation of DREW channels (unidirectional payment channel), and every advertiser's campaign maps to one DREW channel with a certain deposit.

![](<.gitbook/assets/3 (1)>)

The channel is created with the following information:

* deposit: total monetary deposit; this is denoted in tokenAddr and tokenAmount;
* validUntil: the date until this channel is valid; this is also the period within the publishers can withdraw, so it should be longer than the actual specified campaign length (e.g. 3x longer);
* validators: an array of all the validators who are responsible for signing a new state; one of them should represent the advertiser, and the other - the publisher(s);
* spec: describes all the campaign criteria: e.g. buy as many impressions as possible, the maximum price they're willing to pay for impressions, and campaign duration; this is stored as arbitrary bytes (32); in the platform, we encode the criteria directly in there, but it can be used to reference a JSON descriptor stored on IPFS.

The Ethereum implementation of this component is called Blockchain-Ads-protocol-eth. While the current running implementation of Blockchain-Ads is built on Hyperledger blockchain, we are also deploying on Polygon and Polkadot.

The on-chain interactions are:

* channelOpen(channel): open an DREW channel;
* channelWithdraw(state, signatures, merkleProof, amount): allows anyone who earned from this channel to withdraw their earnings by providing (state, signatures) and merkleProof;
* channelExpiredWithdraw(channel): allows the channel creator to withdraw the remaining deposit in a channel after it expires; not needed on blockchain platforms where we can define our own "end block" function, like Polygon/Polkadot.

For more information on how the payment channels work, see DREW.

### 4.2 Marketplace <a href="#_ov8z814ochyf" id="_ov8z814ochyf"></a>

The market is a RESTful service maintained and hosted by Blockchain-Ads Network.

The primary role of the market is to facilitate demand/supply discovery and trading. It keeps record of all campaigns that are currently valid, and allows publishers/advertisers to query that list in order to find what they need.

The market needs to track all on-chain DREW channels and needs to constantly monitor their liveness (>=2/3 validators online and producing new states) and state.

Additional privacy can be achieved by having groups of publishers/advertisers run their own instances of the market - that way, campaigns will be visible only within their private group.

The market is currently implemented in the Blockchain-Ads-market repository. Because of its aggregation-only role, it can be considered a back-end to the Platform.

**4.2.1 Header Bidding Technology**

Header bidding is very rapidly replacing RTB in the adtech industry. Header bidding is the process of pulling all the bids in the browser, evaluating them and then sending the preferred bids to the ad exchange. In Blockchain-Ads, there is no classic ad exchange, but what we do is even more convenient: we pull all information about demand (campaigns, bids) in the browser, and directly select the bid depending on what we know about the user, therefore implementing targeting without revealing the user's profile.

In other words, in Blockchain-Ads, advertisers can bid for an impression in real-time, but we do not implement traditional real-time bidding.

Real-time bidding (RTB) is something we intentionally left out of the protocol, primarily because it relies on some details about the user being propagated around the network to the exchange.

From a scalability perspective, real-time bidding can be implemented using off-chain scaling solutions, however the privacy trade-off is too big.

![](.gitbook/assets/4)

**4.2.2 Campaign Details**

In the Marketplace, each DREW channel has its own spec, which is an arbitrary blob of bytes designed to contain any additional information for this channel.

In the Blockchain-Ads Protocol, we use that field for a specification of the advertising campaign, by referencing a JSON blob of the campaignSpec format.

To do that, we set the spec value to a 32-byte IPFS hash of the JSON blob, using the SHA2-256 digest function.

If you're a dApp builder, it is recommended that you pin this file on your own IPFS nodes. However, this file will also be permanently stored by the Marketplace when it's uploaded to it.

For the JSON blob specification, see campaignSpec. It includes a detailed description of the campaign, including min/max impression prices, targeting, ad units etc.; currently, the format is specific to Blockchain-Ads, but AdCOM might be incorporated in the future.

9Paying by impression (CPM) or by click (CPC)

It's possible to pay for advertising in any way by configuring a campaign goal - e.g. by impression, by click, or even by number of user registrations (CPA).

However, the default option is always impressions as we believe that this creates the best incentives. Paying by click implies more risk and unpredictability, since the publishers will be pushing impressions out without prior knowledge of how much a certain ad will convert.

Ultimately, the raw resource the publisher provides is impressions, and the conversion rate of the ad depends mostly on the advertiser.

**4.2.3 Reporting and analytics**

The validators of a DREW channel are usually two instances of the validator stack: one represents the advertiser, and the other represents multiple publishers.

This means they receive all the data related to this DREW channel, therefore allowing them to aggregate it into useful reports.

This architecture ensures that both parties get their analytical reports by aggregating the data directly from the users, which ensures reporting transparency.

In order to maintain compatibility with the existing Blockchain-Ads infrastructure (the Platform and the Server), you don't need to follow the architecture outlined in validator-stack., but you need to implement the same RESTful APIs.

### 4.3 Platform <a href="#_8l5irbd6fmdq" id="_8l5irbd6fmdq"></a>

The primary implementation is Blockchain-Ads-Server-manager, which is designed for the web. It's important to note that the Platform is entirely browser-agnostic. It can run as a library (alongside React or any other modern framework) or in an \<iframe> on the publisher's webpage.

The Platform is responsible for:

1. Pulling all possible demand (campaigns, bids) from the Blockchain-Ads Marketplace;
2. Picking which ad to show depending on the user: this depends on a combination of price and targeting (header bidding and contextual targeting);
3. Generating events (impressions, clicks) and sending them to all validators and observers of the given ad;

**4.3.1 Contextual targeting**

Notice a common pattern here: sensitive information never leaves the user's browser, and this is achieved by shifting the process of targeting (selecting ads) to the browser itself. To achieve this, we use contextual targeting.

This works by relying on publishers to feed what they know about the context (e.g. "this page is about bicycles") and potentially the user (e.g. "this user is female") directly into the Server API. The incentive for this is built-in: better targeted ads mean higher revenues.

This system is based on tags, which are not specified in the Blockchain-Ads protocol itself and are entirely defined by network participants. They could describe anything - interests, demographics, geographics, etc.

**4.3.2 Behavioral targeting**

Because contextual targeting has certain limitations (e.g. no remarketing), there is a possibility to introduce behavioral targeting. This will not compromise privacy, because the data collected is not exposed to any third parties.

To achieve this, the Server always has to be loaded from the same domain (e.g. Blockchain-Ads.com). This can be trust-minimized in the future through ENS, IPFS or even just using checksum-based integrity checks.

Advertisers may report tags that allow for remarketing, such as a tag indicating that a user visited their website, or even a tag indicating they've visited a particular page, allowing for dynamic remarketing.

### 5. User EcoSystem <a href="#_q71hif8ola46" id="_q71hif8ola46"></a>

When the system reaches widespread adoption, users can start to use Blockchain-Ads “Ad NFT”. For example, a user can use Ad NFT that will completely change the way users interact with advertising as it is. All the data and all preferences will be logged and stored in a digital identity signature, something we like to call “Ad NFT”.

**5.1 The Blockchain-Ads “Ad NFT”**

The Blockchain-Ads “Ad NFT” is a user-facing part of Blockchain-Ads that allows the user to control their ad preferences.

In particular, all user ad preferences and interests will be stored onchain using DIgital Signature Validator, and it will belong solely to the user forever.

Users can opt out of seeing certain kinds of ads, can log their interest and can charge other third parties for using their data.

With Digital Identity Adoption, it's possible for users to earn monetary rewards as well, so at some point the “Ad NFT” may be used to allow for users to withdraw their funds.

The public implementation of the “Ad NFT” is planned at the end of 2022 .

#### &#x20;<a href="#_gxpxmvjydptn" id="_gxpxmvjydptn"></a>

**5.2 Privacy of the end-user**

Privacy of end users is protected by not collecting any data at all, at any part of the system. Instead, we leverage contextual targeting.

Furthermore, we have moved the process of selecting an ad to show to the user's browser, which is essentially equivalent header bidding but with stronger privacy guarantees. This ensures that user data never needs to be exposed/revealed.

A further advantage to this approach is that the user can easily control what kinds of ads they see, without this being revealed to third parties.

To ensure that infrastructure providers such as the Market and validators have no ability to collect data, Server sends no identifiable user data when interacting with them. Furthermore, each ad campaign can be handled by different validators to ensure that the validator operators cannot perform side-channel attacks. Finally, validators are required to implement the EFF's Do not track policy.

**5.3 Rewarding end-users for attention**

Through “Ad NFT”, it's possible that users are rewarded for certain events.

We do intend to implement this capability in the validator stack once we analyze the implications and risks. Once we've established a model we're confident with, we will make this configurable through the campaignSpec.

In technical terms, everything needed to do this is there - every user signs an event with a keypair (which can be used for receiving funds), DREW channels allow easy micropayments, and users would be able to see their earnings and withdraw them through the Blockchain-Ads Stage UI.

The fund flow would be: advertiser -> {publisher AND user}.

### Appendix <a href="#_ctnxhjj1zhes" id="_ctnxhjj1zhes"></a>

#### 1. Autonomous regulation <a href="#_f00kk0z5dvbd" id="_f00kk0z5dvbd"></a>

Ultimately, Blockchain-Ads is completely censorship resistant since anyone can run their own Marketplace and Platform and do whatever they want with them.

However, there are plenty of situations where you need control; for example, as a publisher, you may want your website to be free of deceptive ads (malvertising).

The Blockchain-Ads components provide multiple ways for the system to self regulate:

* Publishers can whitelist or blacklist advertisers or ad units;
* Advertisers can whitelist or blacklist publishers, topics (tags) or individual ad slots;
* Users can blacklist ad units, advertisers and even topics (tags).

Further down the line, reputation systems could be developed to make it easier for participants to push out low quality or deceptive ads.

#### 2. Preventing fraud/attacks <a href="#_fifileowj29s" id="_fifileowj29s"></a>

One of the main challenges of any digital advertising system is preventing fake or invalid impressions/clicks.

There are a few ways to mitigate that in Blockchain-Ads:

1. Traditional adtech methods, such as IP whitelists/blacklists, as well as verifying publishers by their domain name
2. The Server has to send each event to each validator, and they will keep an internal ledger of IPs events came from and impose a limit
3. Requiring a proof of work challenge to be solved in order to submit a click/impression message, therefore making it more expensive than the reward you'd get for the corresponding event
4. The Server allows publishers to vouch for users of their website/app, for example if a user registers on your website and verifies a valid phone number; that allows users to gain reputation as "real" users, and therefore more conservative advertisers may define in their campaigns to only target users above a certain threshold

Blockchain-Ads tries to make it as hard as possible. We believe the transparent reporting aspect of the system, combined with the "custom events", which allow you to track end results (e.g. registrations, purchases, etc.), ensure that the incentives for fraud are significantly reduced.

#### 3. Privacy of publishers/advertisers <a href="#_fqzebh8tvqse" id="_fqzebh8tvqse"></a>

There's nothing in Blockchain-Ads requiring advertisers/publishers to identify themselves with anything other than a cryptographic identity. Information that might reveal more (e.g. ad unit info, web addresses, creatives) is kept off-chain and and revealed between parties only with explicit consent.

Furthermore, the full event history is distributed across validators/observers. Each validator will only collect the full event history for the channels they're validating.

In other words, sensitive and valuable data is kept private to the parties that have accumulated it, and relationships between publishers/advertisers cannot be publicly traced.

Anyone in the network can query any validators for events, but only for the events that they're involved in. For example, if you're a publisher/advertiser/user, you can query all validators to get the events related to you.

Please note that the entire balance tree of each channel will be revealed to everyone at all times, (1) to allow earners (publishers) to observe it's validity and (2) it will be revealed on-chain anyway once everyone withdraws.

#### 4. Identity <a href="#_4bl5f6hbl39n" id="_4bl5f6hbl39n"></a>

The Identity layer is currently specific to our Vulos.io implementation and designed to streamline the user experience of the Platform.

It is a smart contract that allows the users of the Platform (publishers/advertisers) to:

* Use many devices (e.g. PC, mobile, HW wallet) as one identity, without having to share the same private key between them (essentially a multisig)&#x20;
* Allow certain actions to be scheduled/performed automatically without needing them to be online, for example withdrawing funds from DREW channels (called "sweeping" to distinguish it from actual withdrawing)

This solves many UX hurdles that are typical for blockchain-related applications.

In the Platform, we also allow the so-called "Quick accounts' ': you can sign up with an email/passphrase, and the Platform will generate and store a keypair for you, encrypted with your passphrase. Because this is suboptimal for security, those accounts may be limited (by the Market) in terms of DAI they can earn. However, thanks to the Identity layer, those accounts can be easily secured by de-authorizing the temporary keypair and authorizing a proper wallet such as Metamask/Trezor.

### Growth plan <a href="#_elxrpko2qkw7" id="_elxrpko2qkw7"></a>

Blockchain-Ads EcoSystem is under active development.

Blockchain-Ads Adserver and Blockchain-Ads platform have completed MVP stage. The platform is functional and currently is connected with several ad networks and publishers.

Bringing Blockchain-Ads ecosystem to full operaple and scalable stage, will take 1 - 6 months depending on funding levels.

Finishing development of Blockchain-Ads “Ad NFT’ will take another 3 – 12 months.

The, future adserver development to enable serving ads to the metaverse and intergration with the most scalable metaverse projects will take 12-15 months

Simultaneously, we will make further efforts to find business partners in the ad market and start running gateways to existing ad exchanges. By copying inventory from existing ad networks, we will have a good offer for advertisers and publishers from day one.
